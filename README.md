Just an example project demonstrating use of django, python, mysql for a simple turn based game server where users join rooms and take turns making moves (could be used by a board game client, etc)

Uses redis, memcached for caching to avoid always reading/writing from mysql

Also uses puppet for easier configuration/installation
